# CS-Directional
Compressed sensing for directional data. This dataset will be written from scratch, attempting to do so in Cython, so that we can have a code that is optimal for data that is directional in nature (e.g. diffusion data). By doing this, we have a chance at creating our own method for solving the compressed sensing minimization problem
